# MTE_causal

We uploaded the code of matlab version and python version, including the complete algorithm process.

For the methods of finding the embedding and tau and the significance analysis, the python code provides them, and it is also recommended to choose a more appropriate method based on your own data.

## Important code:
For matlab: Lorenz_test.m.  Just run it with supplementary materials (matlab)

For python: Inte_CTE.py.  You need data; for example, you can download the Lorenz data or any other interesting dataset.

## Supplementary materialsï¼š

For matlab: Lorenz.m kernel_entropy.m p_test.m kRTE2.m

For python: utils.py (the code including complete algorithm of matrix-based transfer entropy)
